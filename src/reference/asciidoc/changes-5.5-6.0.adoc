==== @Poller

The messaging annotations

- `@Aggregator`
- `@BridgeFrom`
- `@BridgeTo`
- `@Filter`
- `@InboundChannelAdapter`
- `@Router`
- `@ServiceActivator`
- `@Splitter`
- `@Transformer`

used to contain a `Poller[]` attribute but now contain a single element. The array was only in place  to allow an empty default (no poller). This is now accomplished with a single element using the special value of `ValueConstants.DEFAULT_NONE`.
